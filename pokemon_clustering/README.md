# Pokemon Clustering (SeCo framework)

Abstract

This project explores unsupervised grouping of Pokémon using the SeCo (Separation–Concordance) framework applied to base stat data. Starting from a raw `pokemon_stats.csv` (contains multiple rows per Pokémon for different abilities/forms), the notebook deduplicates entries, standardizes six base stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, Speed), and uses large-scale randomized K‑means sampling to measure both cluster separation and solution concordance. The SeCo analysis recommends an actionable k (k = 5 in the notebook) and the repo includes code and visualizations to inspect cluster characteristics and per-type stat profiles.

Quick start (for new contributors)

1. Requirements (suggested):
   - Python 3.9+ (or 3.8+)
   - numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy, joblib, matplotlib, seaborn

   You can install the main packages with:

```powershell
python -m pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn scipy joblib matplotlib seaborn
```

2. Data
   - The dataset is at `data/pokemon_stats.csv` (raw: 2,552 rows).
   - The notebook performs deduplication and uses 1,025 unique Pokémon for clustering.

3. Run the main analysis
   - Open and run the notebook `notebooks/pokemon_clustering.ipynb` in Jupyter / VS Code.
   - The notebook is organized as: EDA → Data transformation → SeCo analysis → Final clustering → Visualizations → Conclusions.

4. Quick reproducible export
   - A convenience script `scripts/export_cluster_members.py` creates `data/cluster_members_k5.csv` (Cluster → Pokémon listing) using the same preprocessing and final KMeans (k=5, random_state=42).

Key results (documented in the notebook)
- Final recommended k: 5
- Unique Pokémon used for clustering: 1,025
- Features used: HP, Att, Def, S.Att, S.Def, Spd
- SeCo parameters (notebook): k_range = 2..14, kmsamples = 10,000 runs per k, topsep = 100 (top solutions per k used for concordance)

Repository layout

- `data/`
  - `pokemon_stats.csv` — raw stats input
  - `cluster_members_k5.csv` — exported mapping (Cluster → Pokémon), generated by `scripts/export_cluster_members.py`
- `notebooks/`
  - `pokemon_clustering.ipynb` — main analysis notebook (EDA, SeCo, clustering, visualizations)
- `scripts/`
  - `export_cluster_members.py` — small script to export cluster membership using k=5
- `src/`
  - `SeCo.md` — explanatory notes and example code for the SeCo method
- `README.md` — this document

Notes, reproducibility, and next steps

- The notebook runs an expensive SeCo workflow by default (130,000 KMeans runs total when kmsamples=10,000 for k=2..14). For quick experimentation, reduce `kmsamples` to 1,000–2,000 and/or narrow `k_range`.
- Final reported clusters are produced with deterministic KMeans (`random_state=42`) so the exported `cluster_members_k5.csv` is reproducible.
- Suggested follow-ups for the project:
  - Add a `requirements.txt` or populate `pyproject.toml` for exact dependency pinning.
  - Move large, generated outputs to an `outputs/` directory and add to `.gitignore` if you don't want to track them in version control.
  - Expand features to include secondary type, abilities, generation/region for enriched clustering.

If you want, I can also:
- Add a `requirements.txt` with pinned versions.
- Add a short notebook top-cell that centralizes SeCo parameters for easy experimentation.
- Move `cluster_members_k5.csv` to `outputs/` and add it to `.gitignore`.
